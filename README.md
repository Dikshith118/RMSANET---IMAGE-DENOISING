# RMSANET---IMAGE-DENOISING
RMSANet (Residual MuThis repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of RMSANet, a deep learning model designed for image denoising. RMSANet integrates multi-scale feature extraction, residual dense blocks (RDBs), and an enhanced attention mechanism to effectively remove noise while preserving fine details and textures.
